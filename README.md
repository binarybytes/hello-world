# hello-world
greetings devs of GitHub!


Today I take my first step towards becoming a software developer. I first want to thank everyone for creating this code hosting platform and for those who take the time to help others. 

I know not a phrase of code yet, but I strive to develop my own apps, sites and provide help to those who need it. 


Thank you Github,
BinaryBytes!!!
